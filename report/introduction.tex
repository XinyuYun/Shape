\section{Introduction}

This is the report for the project of {\it Introductin to Artificial Intelligence course (2015 Fall) at Fudan University}.

Our task is to build a rule-based expert system to recognize simple geometric figures, such as circles, triangle, rectangles, etc. In this report, we describe the design and implementation of a fuzzy expert system for solving the task, evaluate its performance, and finally discuss its limitations.
