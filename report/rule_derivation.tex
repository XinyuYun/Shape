\section{Rule Derivation}

\subsection{Manual Rule Derivation}

After observing a couple of patterns from data in the prototyping set and reasoning about their validities, we come up with several heuristics.

First we notice that $Extent$ is a very good feature to start with: triangles have a $Extent$ ratio close to 0.5, rectangles and squares have a $Extent$ ratio close to 1, while circles and ellipses have a $Extent$ ratio of around 0.75 $\sim$ 0.85.

Then we can use $Thinness$ ratio to distinguish circles and ellipses. Among common 2D figures, circle has the smallest thinness ($=4\pi$).

Similarily, when rectangles have $Thinness$ ratio close to 16, they become squares.

For the feature $Corners$, as mentioned in Section 3.3, it's a very shaky feature for our task. Therefore we decide not to use it.

Finally, we obtain 5 simple rules:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textit{IF Thinness IS LIKE Circle AND Extent IS LIKE ellipse THEN Shape IS Circle}
\item \textit{IF Thinness IS NOT LIKE Circle AND Extent IS LIKE ellipse THEN Shape IS Ellipse}
\item \textit{IF Extent IS LIKE Triangle THEN Shape IS Triangle}
\item \textit{IF Thinness IS LIKE Square AND Extent IS LIKE rectangle THEN Shape IS Square}
\item \textit{IF Thinness IS NOT LIKE Square AND Extent IS LIKE rectangle THEN Shape IS Rectangle}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Autonomous Rule Derivation}

We will discuss the possibility of autonomous rule derivation in Section 7.
